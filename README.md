Cleaned data outputs are in R Data format. Zip file "CSVs" contains CSV versions of output. sp_counties.Rda is an R SpatialPolygonsDataFrame containing county shape data and used for mapping counties.

where DATE is today's date in yyyymmdd format (e.g., ftp://ftp.nass.usda.gov/quickstats/qs.crops_20200429.txt.gz).
